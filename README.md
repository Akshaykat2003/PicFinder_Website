# React + Vite

I created a website called PicFinder, which allows users to find pictures of their choice. When you search for images, PicFinder provides 
multiple pictures related to your search. I built this site using React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It is fully responsive, ensuring a 
seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

✅ I use Unsplash API in the application
✅ I make API Calls in different scenarios
✅ I Use ESLint to fix application issues
